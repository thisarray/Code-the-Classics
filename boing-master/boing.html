                    # pretty simple calculation. Let&#x27;s take a ball which is travelling at 1 metre per second to the right,
                    # and 2 metres per second down. Imagine this is taking place in space, so gravity isn&#x27;t a factor.

                    # direction on the x-axis has been reversed. This is extremely easy to code - &quot;self.dx = -self.dx&quot;.
